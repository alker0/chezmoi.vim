# Why

[chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) makes it much easier for you to manage your dotfiles. `chezmoi` uses special file naming (e.g. `dot_bashrc`) but you get still a syntax highlighting support because `chezmoi edit` resolves special naming before passing files to your editor. However you miss a correct highlighting in the following cases:
- When you edit directly dotfiles without `chezmoi edit`, `vim` does not highlight it.
- If you use template files (the powerful feature of `chezmoi`), `vim` losses an original syntax highlighting

This plugin solves those problems.

# Features

This plugin makes vim treat the files to be edited as follows:
* `dot_bashrc` => `.bashrc`
* `dot_config/git/private_config` => `.config/git/config`

Furthermore, **with keeping original highlighting**, this plugin applies that of `go-template` to template files (e.g. `dot_vimrc.tmpl`), as shown in the demo image.

# Install

:warning: Notes: You must load this plugin before the following timings:
* Calling `filetype on`, `syntax enable` or `syntax on`
* Loading other plugins that include `filetype.vim`
* End of `vimrc`
* End of `init.vim` if you use neovim

If you use [Vim 8 packages](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/repeat.txt.html#packages):
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/alker0/chezmoi.vim ~/.vim/pack/plugins/opt/chezmoi.vim
```
And then insert this line your `vimrc` with taking the above notes into consideration:
```vim
packadd chezmoi.vim
```

You can also use the favorite plugin manager, in that case, make your plugin manager load this plugin earlier than others. You must **not** load this plugin lazily.

# Usage

As always, just run this:
```sh
$ chezmoi edit ~/.bashrc
# or
$ chezmoi cd
$ vim dot_bashrc
```
This plugin resolves the special prefixes automatically therefore highlighting for bash is applied correctly.

If the file is chezmoi template, this plugin merges syntax highlighting as follows:
* `dot_vimrc.tmpl` => `vim` + `go-template`
* `.chezmoitemplates/foo.toml` => `toml` + `go-template`

| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------         |
| `g:chezmoi#loaded`                | 0                                                        | Setting 1 before loading disables this plugin          |
| `g:chezmoi#detect_ignore_pattern` | \<empty string>                                          | Regex pattern of path for ignoring file type detection |
| `g:chezmoi#use_external`          | \<not set>                                               | If set, enables the use of the external chezmoi binary for various purposes. More advanced, but slower. See comments below for more details |
| `g:chezmoi#source_dir_path`       | The value returned by `chezmoi source-path` (if the use of external chezmoi is enabled) or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/chezmoi` or `$HOME/.local/share/chezmoi` | Source Directory managed by chezmoi |

* Note: to enable the use of the external chezmoi binary, set the `g:chezmoi#use_external` variable. This variable must be set in `.vimrc` file, before the plugin is sourced. The value must be either a valid path to the binary, or just the binary name, if it can be found in `$PATH`. Alternatively, the value can be set to 1, in which case the plugin will try to detect the binary name automatically. After the plugin is sourced, the value of this variable may change. It will contain either the full name of the chezmoi binary that is used, or empty if the external chezmoi can not be used for some reason.
